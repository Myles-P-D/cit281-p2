## CIT 281 p2

## Outcome:   
   
This project aimed to continue teaching the command line to us as well as instill refactoring of code to   
make it smaller, more readble, and simpler. This project we used git to track changes and format our code into text files.   
The code for this project returns random stings and sorts them.
